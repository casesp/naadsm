  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 all units will be Latent.
     - On day 2 all units will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be detected
       and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 all units will be destroyed.  Their state will appear as
       Destroyed on day 4.

    Test tracing out.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the source unit (but not the receiving unit) is
    detected.  In this, the base test scenario, there is no tracing, so the
    receiving unit should not be destroyed.

    For pigs (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without

    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The mean movement rate from pig units to cattle units is 0.694 per day,

  <description>
    Test a scenario where an infected unit ships animals to a neighbouring
    unit, that unit in turn infects another, then the original source unit (but
    not the others) is detected.  Since trace out goes only 1 step forward,
    only the unit that received the first shipment should be found by trace out
    and destroyed.

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 2
    days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (units 0 and 1), the latent
    period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The mean movement rate from pig units to cattle units is 0.694 per day,
    which will give 1 shipment each day when used with fixed "random" numbers
    of 0.5.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The parameters for
    movement from cattle units to cattle units are the same.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased pigs vs. the number of days they have
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detecting
    diseased pigs vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting diseased
    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 1 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Latent.  It will ship to and infect unit 0
       (cattle).
     - On day 3 unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected
       and slated for destruction.  Trace out will discover the shipment from
       unit 2 to unit 1, and unit 1 will will also be slated for destruction.
       Trace out will fail to discover the shipment from unit 1 to unit 0.
     - On day 4 units 1 and 2 will be destroyed.

    Test that trace out investigations can be limited to a certain number of
    days back.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the source unit (but not the receiving unit) is
    detected several days later, inside the time window of interest.  The
    receiving unit should be found by trace out and destroyed.

    This test requires a third unit of a different species, which gets detected
    early and (via movement controls) stops all animal shipments.  This allows
    us to use the probability of detection vs. days that a unit has been
    showing clinical signs to control the delay between the last shipment and
    the trace out investigation.

    Test that traced contacts can be quarantined without being destroyed.  In
    this test and the following four, there are three units of different
    production types:

    0-&gt;1&lt;-2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  Different effects
    can be observed on unit 1 depending on whether unit 0 ships to unit 1, unit
    2 ships to unit 1, or both units 0 and 2 ship to unit 1.  The scenario can
    be further modified by having one of those shipments traced.

    In this scenario, unit 2 does not ship to unit 1, so there is no trace to
    unit 1, no quarantine on unit 1, and no destruction of unit 1.  Unit 0 does
    ship to unit 1 and causes unit 1 to become infected.

       contact with unit 1, so unit 1 will also be marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 (1 day after the first detection) the movement rate multiplier
       for sheep-to-cattle movements will be 1.  Unit 0 (sheep) will ship to
       unit 1, but the shipment won't have an effect because unit 1 is already
       infected.  The destruction program will not be ready for 3 more days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program will not be

  <description>
    Test that traced contacts can be quarantined without being destroyed.  In
    this test, there are three units of different production types:

    0-&gt;1&lt;-2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  Different effects
    can be observed on unit 1 depending on whether unit 0 ships to unit 1, unit
    2 ships to unit 1, or both units 0 and 2 ship to unit 1.  The scenario can
    be further modified by having one of those shipments traced.

    In this scenario, unit 2 ships to unit 1, but the shipment does not result
    in infection and is not traced.  Unit 0 ships to unit 1 and causes unit 1
    to become infected.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 5 days.

    The mean movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is 0.694 per day,
    which will give 1 shipment each day when used with fixed "random" numbers
    of 0.5.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it
    immediately goes to 1.  (This is the opposite of what one might expect from
    movement controls; its purpose here is to make sure any contact we see from
    unit 0 to unit 1 happens after the trace, not before.)  Latent units can be
    the source of an exposure, and the probability of infection given exposure
    is 1.

    The mean movement rate from pig units to cattle units is also 0.694 per
    day, distance 10 km.  The movement rate is unaffected by public knowledge
    of an outbreak.  Latent units can be the source of an exposure, and the
    probability of infection given exposure is 0.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  Other production types are
    not detected.

    The authorities require 3 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities will destroy units that are detected as
    diseased.  The authorities will also destroy trace outs.  The probability
    of success for a trace-out investigation is 0.  The authorities can destroy
    an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.  There will be no
       shipments from unit 0 because the movement rate multiplier is 0.  There
       will be a shipment from unit 2 to unit 1, but unit 1 will not be
       infected (the probability of infection given exposure is too low).
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 (pigs) will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Trace out will fail to discover
       the contact with unit 1, so unit 1 will not be marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 (1 day after the first detection) the movement rate multiplier
       for sheep-to-cattle movements will be 1.  Unit 0 (sheep) will ship to
       and infect unit 1.  The destruction program will not be ready for 3 more
       days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program will not be
       ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 5 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program will not be
       ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 6 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit 2 will be
       destroyed.

    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  The priorities for destruction
    are: units that have received animals from a detected unit = 1, detected
    units = 2, units within 10 km of a detected unit = 3.
    
    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.  The period
    of interest for a trace-out investigation is 14 days back.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 0 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 2 will ship to unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 2 will be detected.  All 3 units will be marked for
       destruction: unit 2 because of the detection, unit 1 because it is
       within 10 km of unit 2, and unit 0 because of trace out.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be destroyed because trace out has the highest
       priority.
     - On day 5 unit 2 will be destroyed because detection has the
       second-highest priority.
     - On day 6 unit 1 will be destroyed because ring destruction has the
       lowest priority.

  <description>
    Test that the number of units awaiting destruction is counted correctly.
    In this scenario, three units will be marked for destruction: one because
    it is detected, another because it received animals from the detected unit,
    and a third because it is near the detected unit.  No unit will be marked
    for destruction for more than one reason.

    The parameters are identical to the test "priority detected &gt; nearby
    &gt; trace out" above.

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (units 0 and 1), the latent period
    lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The mean movement rate from pig units to cattle units is 0.694 per day,
    which will give 1 shipment each day when used with fixed "random" numbers
    of 0.5.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 20 km.  No parameters are
    set for movement from cattle units to pigs units or from cattle units to
    cattle units.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased pigs vs. the number of days they have
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detecting
    diseased pigs vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting diseased
    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  The priorities for destruction
    are: detected units = 1, units within 10 km of a detected unit = 2, units
    that have received animals from a detected unit = 3.

    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.  The period
    of interest for a trace-out investigation is 14 days back.

    There is no vaccination.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 10
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 3), the latent period is 1 day longer, and for
    sheep (units 1 and 2), the latent period is 2 days longer.

    The mean movement rate from pig units to sheep units is 0.694 per day,
    which will give 1 shipment each day when used with fixed "random" numbers
    of 0.5.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 2 km.  Latent units can be
    the source of an exposure.

    The probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number
    of days they have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number of
    days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No
    parameters are set for detecting diseased sheep.

    The authorities require 2 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  Direct contacts
    will be traced and destroyed; the probability of success for a trace-out
    investigation is 1.  Units within 1 km of a detected unit will also be
    destroyed.  The priorities for destruction are: production type (cattle
    &gt; sheep) &gt; time waiting &gt; reason (basic &gt; trace &gt; ring).
    Pigs are not destroyed.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (cattle) and unit 3 (pigs) will be latent.
       Unit 3 will ship to unit 2 (sheep) and infect it.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it is inside a 1 km ring.
     - On day 3 unit 3 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 2 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it received animals from unit 3.  The
       destruction program will not be ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program
       will not be ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 5 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit
       0 will be destroyed because it is cattle.
     - On day 6 the units remaining to be destroyed (1 and 2) are both
       sheep, so time waiting will be used to prioritize them.  Unit 1 will be
       destroyed because it has been waiting since day 2 (unit 2 was marked
       for destruction a day later).
     - On day 7 unit 2 will be destroyed.

    Unit 3 (pigs) is never destroyed.  The simulation ends when unit 3 ceases
    to be infectious.

    For cattle (unit 0, initially infected), the latent period lasts 1 day,
    infectiousness lasts 10 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness
    immediately, and immunity lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 3, initially
    infected), the latent period is 1 day longer.  For sheep and goats (units
    1 and 2), the duration of the disease stages are irrelevant but vaccine
    immunity lasts 5 days.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  Herds within 1 km of
    a detection will be vaccinated.  For the first two days, there is no

    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no disease spread and no destruction.

       capacity will come on-line.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated because it
       is sheep.
     - On day 6 unit 2 will be vaccinated because it is goats.

    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  Units within 0.75 km
    of a detection will be vaccinated.  The authorities have no capacity to
    vaccinate.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity
    lasts 5 days.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - Infection will spread from unit 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 on
       successive days.  
     - Unit 0 will be detected and marked for destruction on day 2
       (when it goes infectious clinical) and destroyed on day 3.  Similarly,
       unit 1 will be destroyed on day 4, unit 2 on day 5, and unit 3 on day 6.
     - No units will be vaccinated because of the lack of vaccination
       resources.

    This is one of a set of 3 tests that check whether a vaccination that is
    cancelled due to destruction coming up on the same day still counts against
    vaccination resources (it should not).

    In this scenario, there is no destruction, so we simply see the result of
    having limited vaccination resources.

    day, and natural immunity lasts 1 day.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    Units detected as diseased will be destroyed.  The authorities require 3
    days to set up a destruction program before beginning.  The destruction
    capacity is zero, so no units will ever actually be destroyed.

    A vaccination program begins at the fourth detection.  Units within 3/4 of
    a km of a detection will be vaccinated.  The authorities can vaccinate 3
    units each day.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the
    immunity lasts 2 days.

    There is no disease spread.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 1, 2, and 3 will be Infectious Clinical (they start out
       that way).  They will be detected and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Because it is the 4th detection, it will start
       a vaccination program.  Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be slated for
       vaccination.
     - On day 4, three of the units will be vaccinated.
     - Day 5 would be the first day destruction is possible (days 2, 3, and 4
       were the 3-day setup delay).  But the destruction capacity is zero, so
       no units will be destroyed.  However, three of the vaccinated units will
       be Vaccine Immune on this day, and the remaining one will be vaccinated.

  <description>
    This is one of a set of 3 tests that check whether a vaccination that is
    cancelled due to destruction coming up on the same day still counts against
    vaccination resources (it should not).

    In this scenario, destruction happens 1 day after vaccination, so it does
    not cancel any vaccinations.
