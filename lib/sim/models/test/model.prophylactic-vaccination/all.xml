  <parameter-description>
    In both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 2 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.
    
    Prophylactic vaccination is done in 100% of cattle units, but not in pig
    units.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 3
    days.  The time between vaccinations is 1 day, which means that
    prophylactic vaccination is done every day.

    What should happen:
     - Unit 1, the cattle unit, starts the simulation infected.  It will
       progress through 1 day latent, 2 days clinical, and on to naturally
       immune.
     - Unit 0, the pig unit, will start vaccine immune.  The parameter for
       the time between vaccinations is 1, which means that vaccination
       happened the day before the simulation begins.  So unit 0 will have all
       3 days of vaccine immunity.
