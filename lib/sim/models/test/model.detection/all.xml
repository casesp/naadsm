    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 1 day.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 the unit will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the unit will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 the unit will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed

    Test that the number of units detected, the cumulative number of units
    detected, and the day of the first detection is reported correctly.  In
    this scenario, the same as "detected on 1st day" above, the disease is
    detected the day the unit first shows clinical signs and the authorities

    Test that the probability of detection can be influenced by days since the
    1st detection.  In this two-unit scenario, the probability of detection vs.
    days since the 1st detection starts low and increases 1 day after the first
    detection.  The probability of detection vs. days showing clinical signs is
    constant for both production types.  For unit 0, this probability is high
    enough to trigger a detection with the baseline (pre-1st detection)
    probability.  For unit 1, the probability of detection vs. days showing
    clinical signs is low enough that it requires the increase in public
    awareness to push the combined probability over the threshold for
    detection.

  <short-name>detection vs. public awareness, subclinical period shorter</short-name>

  <description>
    Test that the probability of detection can be influenced by days since the
    1st detection.  This scenario is identical to "detection vs. public
    awareness, p high enough for unit 1 2 days after 1st detection" above,
    except the subclinical period for unit 1 is 1 day shorter.  The outcome of
    the scenario should be the same as for the earlier test, because it is the
    number of days since the 1st detection, not the number of days into the
    clinical period, that should determine when unit 1 is detected.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  For pigs (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day,
    infectiousness lasts 5 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness
    immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    For cattle, the probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  For pigs, the probability of
    detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is
    fixed at 0.6.  The probability of detection vs. the number of days since a
    public announcement of an outbreak (for both production types) is 0.55 on
    "day 0" (the baseline before the 1st detection) and day 1 (the day after
    the 1st detection), then is 1.0 on day 2 and later.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 both units will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 (cattle) and 1 (pigs) will be Infectious Clinical.  For
       unit 0, the probability of detection = the baseline before the 1st
       detection (0.55) times the value for day 1 of the clinical period
       (1.0) = 0.55.  Unit 0 will be detected and marked for destruction.  For
       unit 1, the probability of detection = the baseline before the 1st
       detection (0.55) times the value for day 1 of the clinical period
       (0.6) = 0.33.  With "fixed" random numbers of 0.5, this is too low for
       detection.  Unit 1 will not be detected.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be destroyed.  The probability of detection for
       unit 1 = the value for 1 day since the 1st detection (0.55) times the
       value for day 2 of the clinical period (0.6) = 0.33.  Unit 1 will not be
       detected.
     - On day 4 the probability of detection for unit 1 = the value for 2 days
       since the 1st detection (1.0) times the value for day 3 of the clinical
       period (0.6) = 0.6.  Unit 1 will be detected and marked for destruction.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed.
