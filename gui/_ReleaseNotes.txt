Version 3.0.78 is the first production release of the North American Animal Disease Spread Model 3.0.  This version has been thoroughly tested by the model development team, and has been deemed stable and suitable for analytical use.  ALL USERS SHOULD UPGRADE TO VERSION 3.0.78 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  

NAADSM 3.0.78 follows version 1.0.6 of the model description document: no further substantial changes will be made to the description document for the 3.0.x development branch of NAADSM.


Version 3.0.78 fixes the following interface problems:
		* Sort capabilities of the events window and the exposures window do not work properly.
		* Sort capabilities fo the herd editor window ("Setup starting units") do not work properly.

These problems in the core model are addressed:
    * It is not possible to trace contacts from an infected herd if they occur on the same day as detection of that herd.
    * Shipping delay is not handled properly.
    * Vaccination capacity of 0 causes simulations to run indefinitely.

Finally, version 3.0.77 introduces the following new capability:
    * Herd list (population) editing has been extensively revised and enhanced.



NOTES FOR 3.0.76
===============
Version 3.0.76 is intended to follow version 1.0.5 of the model specification document, as well as RFC-20060202AR (Trace surveillance).

    * Airborne spread does not effect units which have a direction between 359 and 0 degrees from the source unit.
    * Source and recipient units for airborne spread are incorrectly recorded.


Version 3.0.76 also introduces these new capabilities:
    * Production type descriptions are now displayed in the output events and exposures windows.
    * Disease statuses of source and recipient units involved in exposures are now recorded and displayed.



NOTES FOR 3.0.75
===============
Version 3.0.75 is intended to follow version 1.0.5 of the model specification document, as well as RFC-20060202AR (Trace surveillance). 

Version 3.0.75 fixes the following problem:
    * When a fixed movement rate (rather than a Poisson distribution) is used to generate a daily number of contacts, the fixed rate should still be subject to movement control effects.

NOTES FOR 3.0.69
===============
The attached installation package will perform a new, complete installation of NAADSM version 3.0.69.  If you have installed an earlier version, you MUST uninstall it (through the Windows control panel) before installing this version.  The list of required library files has changed, so it is not possible to update an existing installation to this new version.

To perform a new installation of NAADSM version 3.0.69, please download and run the attached program.  A new icon, labeled 'NAADSM' will be created on your Start menu.

Version 3.0.69 fully implements version 1.0.3 of the model specification: vaccination components are now working as described in the current version of the specification.

NOTES FOR 3.0.62
===============
UPDATED 9/2/05: This build (050902) of NAASDM 3.0.62 provides better handling of non-US regional settings (in particular, date and time formats), more strictly enforces the input of appropriate values for unit latitude and longitude, and corrects a minor problem with the map of units.

UPDATED 9/1/05: This build (050901) of NAADSM 3.0.62 corrects a couple of minor bugs inadvertently introduced in version 3.0.62 build 050830.

This version corrects several problems discovered in the graphical interface and reimplements the ability to add or import herds from CSV or XML files.




NOTES FOR 3.0.60
===============
The new version of the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM) for Windows is now ready for use.  Please review the following notes carefully:

    * While NAADSM bears more than a passing resemblance to SpreadModel, virtually all of the program has been extensively revised:

   1. NAADSM is now intended to comply with Version 1.0.2a of the model specification document (available on QuickPlace)
   2. This application uses the same core code as the Linux/supercomputer version of NAADSM
   3. Licensing issues involving the use of open source software have been resolved (all closed-source commercial components other than those that are part of the core Delphi language have been removed)
   4. Code has been extensively restructured for ease of future maintenance and modification
   5. Documentation of the new program code has been greatly enhanced, but is not yet complete

    * Some features from old versions of SpreadModel have not yet been restored in NAADSM.  Most of these will reappear at some point in the future.
    * Some features of the new application have not yet been optimized for performance: switching back and forth between parameter input screens, in particular, is a bit slow.  This will change in a future version of the program.
    * The database structure for NAADSM has been completely revised, and is not compatible with old SpreadModel databases.  Please use the database conversion utility, found here on QuickPlace.  A comprehensive description of the fields used in the new database may also be found here.
    * There is currently no way to display comprehensive scenario output directly in the model application: to view your output, open the NAADSM database file directly in Microsoft Access (remember to save your scenario file before opening it with MS Access!).  Tabular views of output data will be restored in an upcoming version of NAADSM.
    * The graphical interface for setting scenario parameters has been tested reasonably thoroughly.  Every user, however, does things slightly differently.  If you come across a part of the GUI that "doesn't work", try using the equivalent mouse action instead of the keyboard command, or vice versa.  If you notice anything that does not behave the way that you think it should, please let me know.

Attached is a setup application for NAADSM.  Download and run this program to install NAADSM on your computer.  A new icon, labeled 'NAADSM' will be created on your Start menu.
